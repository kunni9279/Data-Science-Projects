      "His daughter and political heir, Sara Duterte, is the Philippines' current vice-president and is tipped as a potential presidential candidate in 2028.\n",
      "In recent months, the Duterte family's alliance with incumbent President Ferdinand Marcos unraveled spectacularly before the public view, soon after Marcos and Sara Duterte won the 2022 elections by a landslide.\n",
      "Marcos initially refused to co-operate with the ICC investigation, but as his relationship with the Duterte family deteriorated, he changed his stance, and later indicated that the Philippines would co-operate.\n",
