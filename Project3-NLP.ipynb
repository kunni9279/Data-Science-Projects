      "Sentence 12: The World Cup is the most prestigious association football competition in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world.[2][3] The viewership of the 2018 World Cup was estimated to be 3.57 billion, close to half of the global population,[4][5] while the engagement with the 2022 World Cup was estimated to be 5 billion, with about 1.5 billion people watching the final match.[6] Seventeen countries have hosted the World Cup, most recently Qatar, who hosted the 2022 event.\n",
      "Sentence 13: The 2026 tournament will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three World Cups.\n",
      "Sentence 14: The world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England.[7] The first international tournament for nations, the inaugural British Home Championship, took place in 1884 and included games between England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.[8]\n",
      "Sentence 15: As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics; however, the International Olympic Committee has retroactively upgraded their status to official events, as well as the 1906 Intercalated Games.[9]\n",
      "Sentence 16: After FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906.\n",
      "Sentence 17: These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been unsuccessful.[10] At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, football became an official Olympic sport.\n",
      "Sentence 18: Planned by The Football Association (FA), England's football governing body, the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition.\n",
      "Sentence 19: Great Britain (represented by the England national amateur football team) won the gold medals.\n",
      "Sentence 20: They repeated the feat at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.[11] With the Olympic event continuing to be a contest between amateur teams only, Sir Thomas Lipton organised the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909.\n",

      "Sentence 24: West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.[13] Prior to the Lipton competition, from 1876 to 1904, games that were considered to be the \"football world championship\" were meetings between leading English and Scottish clubs, such as the 1895 game between Sunderland A.F.C. and the Heart of Midlothian F.C., which Sunderland won.[14]\n",
      "Sentence 25: In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a \"world football championship for amateurs\", and took responsibility for managing the event.[15] This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition for nations, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, contested by Egypt and 13 European teams, and won by Belgium.[16]\n",
      "Sentence 26: Uruguay won the next two Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928.\n",
      "Sentence 27: Those were also the first two open world championships, as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era, and is the reason why Uruguay is allowed to wear 4 stars.[17][18] Due to the success of the Olympic football tournaments, FIFA, with President Jules Rimet as the driving force, again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics.\n",
      "Sentence 28: On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam decided to stage a world championship.[19] With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country of the inaugural World Cup tournament.[20]\n",
      "Sentence 29: The national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides, especially in the midst of the Great Depression.\n",
      "Sentence 30: As such, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition.\n",
      "Sentence 31: Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip.[20]\n",

      "Sentence 36: After the creation of the World Cup, FIFA and the IOC disagreed over the status of amateur players; football was dropped from the 1932 Summer Olympics.[24][25]\n",
      "Sentence 37: After the IOC and FIFA worked out their differences, Olympic football returned at the 1936 Summer Olympics, but was now overshadowed by the more prestigious World Cup.[24]\n",
      "Sentence 38: The issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war.\n",
      "Sentence 39: Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the 1934 World Cup and all North and South American nations except Brazil and Cuba boycotted the 1938 tournament.\n",
      "Sentence 40: Brazil was the only South American team to compete in both.\n",
      "Sentence 41: The 1942 and 1946 competitions, which Germany and Brazil sought to host,[26] were cancelled due to World War II.[27]\n",
      "Sentence 42: The 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was the first to include British football associations.\n",
      "Sentence 43: Scotland, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland had withdrawn from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football.[28]\n",
      "Sentence 44: The teams rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation.[29]\n",
      "Sentence 45: The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups.\n",

      "Sentence 47: In the tournaments between 1934 and 1978, 16 teams competed in each tournament, except in 1938, when Austria was absorbed into Germany after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when India, Scotland, and Turkey withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams.[31] Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania.\n",
      "Sentence 48: These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams.\n",
      "Sentence 49: Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: United States, semi-finalists in 1930; Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in 1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970.\n",
      "Sentence 50: The tournament was expanded to 24 teams in 1982,[32] and then to 32 in 1998,[33] allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part.\n",
      "Sentence 51: Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals: Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1986; Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; South Korea, finishing in fourth place in 2002; Senegal, along with USA, both quarter-finalists in 2002; Ghana, quarter-finalists in 2010; Costa Rica, quarter-finalists in 2014; and Morocco, finishing in fourth place in 2022.\n",
      "Sentence 52: European and South American teams continue to dominate, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2018 were all from Europe or South America and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far.\n",

      "Sentence 58: It cannot be that the European and South American confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the World Cup.\"[36]\n",
      "Sentence 59: Those two remarks suggested to commentators that Blatter could be putting himself forward for re-election to the FIFA Presidency.[37]\n",
